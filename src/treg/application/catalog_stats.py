"""Fold `callrecord` into per-endpoint, per-day reliability buckets (`EndpointDayStat`).

Why this exists: the catalog's "does it still work, how fast" numbers can require a thirty-day
aggregate over the audit table (`domain.catalog.stats.observed`) whenever a web process's cache
expires, and again from cold after a deploy. The `treg-worker catalog stats` cron folds new audit
evidence incrementally so eligible endpoints read small day buckets. Async endpoints with result
adapters still read observations live, and an absent, incomplete or stale worker still triggers
live fallback. This stage adds background correction without changing that reader or cache policy;
it does not remove the remaining slow aggregate.

How it walks the table: by primary key from a persisted cursor, never by `created_at` (the audit
table has no bare `created_at` index, and does not need one for this). Rows younger than `LAG`
are left for the next run: an audit insert commits a few seconds after its `created_at`, and the
ids are handed out at insert, so a row that is still uncommitted when a run passes its id is
always younger than the lag and everything from the first young row onward is deferred. Audit is
lossy by design (`audit.py` sheds rows under load), so the one remaining race, a row queued for
longer than the lag before its insert, only ever undercounts a day by a row it already might have
lost. The first run starts at the id of the first row inside the window, found by bisection on
the primary key so the backfill never scans a row older than the window. Until a run catches up,
readers retain their existing live aggregation.

Late terminal corrections are coalesced in `EndpointStatDirty`. Each repair replaces one UTC day
bucket, under the same cursor lock as the append fold, and includes only already-folded ids.
Old mutable buckets are seeded for repair, and `terminal_reconciled` records their readiness for a
separate reader change. The current reader ignores that flag and the dirty queue. Repairs have
both per-bucket and per-pass budgets; a failed bucket remains queued with retry backoff.

This module is the only runtime writer of `endpointdaystat` and `endpointstatcursor`. Audit marks
dirty buckets; this worker acknowledges them after replacement, in the same transaction.
